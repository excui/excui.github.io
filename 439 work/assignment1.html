          This is the schematic for the created blinking LED circuit. The circuit uses 3 different pins with 3 LED bulbs,
          each using a 220 ohm resistor.
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>
          A 220 ohm resistor is used as it ensures that the current flowing through each of the bulbs remain lower than
          a 20 mA current limit. The following calculations below showcase how much current is flowing through each LED with a 
          220 ohm resistor:

          Green and Yellow LED:
          <pre>5V - 1.8V = 3.2 V</pre>
          <pre>3.2V / 220 &#937 = <u>0.0145 A or 14.5 mA</u></pre>

          White LED:
          <pre>5V - 3.3V = 1.7 V</pre>

      <h4>
        Question 1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.

    <div class="question">
      <h4>
        Question 2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
      </h4>
      <p>A total of 20 LEDs can be blinked independently. Assuming I'm using all blue LEDs and 220 &#937 resistors
        , 20 LEDs would draw 154 mA or 0.154 A
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Calculation:</p>
      <pre>5V - 3.3V = 1.7 V</pre>
      <pre>1.7 V / 220 &#937 = 0.0077 A or 7.7 mA per LED</pre>
      <pre>7.7 mA * 20 = <u>0.154 A or 154 mA total</u></pre>

      <h4>
        Question 3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
      </h4>
      <p>The LEDs should blink between 1 to 3 milliseconds to make it so that you can longer tell that they are blinking.</p>

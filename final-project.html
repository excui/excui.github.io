    <h2>Project Description & Concept</h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="a1">
      <p>
        For my final project, I created a circuit and prototype product of a handheld heat 
        sensor and alarm that I can use to help prevent accidentally burning myself on hot 
        surfaces, mainly since I cook a lot. With this product, I should be able to know visually 
        and through audio whether or not the surface of an object or the surrounding close 
        environment is too hot for me to touch. The following technical implementaiton documents 
        how I built my product and circuit to meet my requirements.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The following image below is a sketch for the inital concept for my project.
      </p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p>
        My final project remains fairly similar to the original concept; however, I did make some additions and changes to 
        improve the user experience. First, I swapped out the LED for a 4-digit 7-segment display to make reading the temperature 
        much more useful and informative rather than a light going on and off. Second, I also added a button as an input device as I found 
        it to be more logical for the user to be able to turn the device on and off rather than having it constantly running whenever it was plugged 
        into a power source.

      <h3>Circuit Schematic & Calculations</h3>
      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="final-project-schematic.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>
          This is the schematic for my entire circuit. The circuit uses a multitude of parts: 
          <li>a thermistor voltage divider (input)</li>
          <li>a push-button (input)</li>
          <li>a 4-digit 7-segment LED display (output)</li>
          <li>an active buzzer (output)</li>
          <li>1k &#937 and 10k &#937 resistors</li>
        </figcaption>
        <br>
      </figure>
      <p>
        For the display, I utilized a total of three 1k &#937 resistors. Using these resistors 
        ensures that there isn't too much current flowing through the display as there are 
        many parts and components needed to light up the number placements that I used for my 
        project. At the same time, these resistors are able to limit current and make sure
        that the brightness of my lights is appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically focusing on the resistance values for the display, the 1k &#937 resistors that correspond to each individual number on the display, which can show up to 4 digits. 
        I retrieved the necessary information on the maximum current from the following datasheet reference: <a href="https://github.com/keopx/Arduino/blob/master/Elegoo%20The%20Most%20Complete%20Starter%20Kit%20for%20MEGA%20V1.0.2017.10.31/Datasheet/4%20digit%207-segment%20Display%20.PDF">4 Digit 7 Segment Display Datasheet</a>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        From the datasheet, we can see that the maximum current and the voltage drop will differ based on the color that's being displayed. Since I am only using red lights, 
        my forward current and the amount I shouldn't exceed will be around 50 mA. The forward voltage is around 1.2 V, so I can calcuate my voltage drop with that value. With this, 
        I want to ensure that I'm not sending too much current through the display, and the following calculations below show this:
      </p>
      <br>
      <code>
        <p>
          <pre>5V - 1.2V = 3.8 V</pre>
          <pre>3.2V / 1000 &#937 = <u>0.0032 A or 3.2 mA</u></pre>
        </p>
      </code>
      <br>
      <p>
        For the button, I used a 10k &#937 resistor to reduce the amount of current that is going to through the button.
        Furthermore, the resistor also allows the HIGH and LOW states of the button to be properly read. 
        No resistor or a resistor that has too low of a value will not allow the button to function as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the resistance for the thermistor voltage-divier, assuming we calculated the resistance within the thermistor, we can show how a 10k &#937 is an appropriate 
        choice to use in the voltage-divier. We know that a 10k &#937 resistor is appropriate by showing how the current is being limited
        in the voltage divider when the thermistor has no resistance:
      </p>
      <br>
      <code>
      <p>V = I*R, and we know that the total voltage is 5V based on our arduino</p>
      <br>
      <p>Based on the formula, as R continues to grow smaller, then the current will continue to grow larger,
      which is not ideal for my circuit.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Thus, the total resistance of the voltage divider must be a much larger value in order to limit the current
            in the circuit. We also must take into account when the variable voltage has a value of 0 &#937. Because of this, 
            the standard constant resistor must be a large value, which is why we use a 10k &#937 resistor.
      </p>
      <pre>I = 5 V / 10k &#937 = <u>0.0005 A or 0.5 mA</u></pre>
      <br>
      <p>
        Using the 10k &#937 resistor, the following calculations below showcase what voltages can
        be read by the thermistor voltage divider:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>(1)</p>
      <p>
        If we calculated that the thermistor had a value of 5k &#937:
        <pre>V(out) = [10k &#937 / (5k &#937 + 10k &#937)] * 5V</pre>
        <pre>V(out) = (10k &#937 / 15k &#937) * 5V</pre>
        <pre><u>V(out) = 3.33 V</u></pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>(2)</p>
      <p>
        If we calculated that the thermistor had a value of 2k &#937:
        <pre>V(out) = [10k &#937 / (2k &#937 + 10k &#937)] * 5V</pre>
        <pre>V(out) = (10k &#937 / 12k &#937) * 5V</pre>
        <pre><u>V(out) = 4.17 V</u></pre>

      <h3>Functional Writeup</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Starting from the circuit, as shown in the schematic, I used mutliple input and output devices to 
        create my product. The input devices are my thermistor and the push-button. The thermistor is connected with a 10k &#937 
        resistor to create a voltage divider that can read a change in resistance based on the temperature 
        that I'm trying to read. I added a button, which was not a part of my original proposal, as I didn't want the 
        product to be constantly running. The button allows me to only turn on the device when I want to read a temperature, and not holding the button 
        ensures that the device is not running.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        From the schematic, we can see that these two input devices are connected to shared power and ground. Doing so allowed me to save 
        space on my arduino due to the number of wires and pins I needed to create my circuit and device. However, the two inputs serve fairly 
        different purposes in my code. The button reads simple high or low values. Reading HIGH, or when the button is held down, ensures that the remainging code 
        including running the calculations from the thermistor is running. Reading LOW, the code and device is not reading any values. Generating the correct 
        temperature from the thermistor requires more complicated calculations, which can be observed in the references I provided in my code.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For the thermistor, since it does not provide us with the actual temperature in the voltage divider set-up, we need to write code that can covert the voltage, determined by the read analog value, into 
        resistance, and then into the temperature in Farenheit. Though it's possible to also convert it into Celcius, I'm personally more accustomed to reading 
        and understanding Farenheit. Additionally, I used another 10k &#937 resistor with the thermistor to create a voltage divider that allows us to detect the changes in temperature. A 10k &#937 resistor 
        also limits the amount of current going through the voltage divider.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Moving on to the output devices, I used a 4-digit 7-segment display and an active buzzer. From the schematic, we can see that the output devices are pretty independent from each other, especially due to the large number 
        of wires needed to properly utilize the display compared to the two positive and negative wires that is required by the buzzer. The display shows the temperatures, that we 
        read from the thermistor and calculated in our code, and the buzzer emits a high-pitch sound if the temperature crosses a certain thershold. 
        In my case, I put the threshold at 90 degrees, so turning on the device near any object or environment that's hotter will produce a sound from the buzzer.
        If the temperature is lower than 90, then the buzzer will not produce a sound.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Lastly, putting all of the circuit parts together, I created the box and product surrounding the circuit with cardboard and foil, making a simple 
        cardboard prototype. There's a small pillar-like object that's attached to the top of the box that presses down on the button inside without the user having to press on the actual button. There are a also a number of small openings that I made in the box to ensure that I can connect a battery to it and also allowing 
        the air and temperature to be read by the thermistor without the box insulating the heat.

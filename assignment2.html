      <h3>Circuit Schematic</h3>

        <figcaption>
          This is the schematic for the created blinking LED circuit. The circuit uses 4 different pins for the 4 LEDs, each using a 220 &#937 resistor,
          and the push-button uses one 10k &#937 resistor.
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>
          A 220 ohm resistor is used as it ensures that the current flowing through each of the red LEDs remain lower than
          a 20 mA current limit. The following calculations below showcase how much current is flowing through each LED with a 
          220 ohm resistor:
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>
          Red LEDs:
          <pre>5V - 1.8V = 3.2 V</pre>
          <pre>3.2V / 220 &#937 = <u>0.0145 A or 14.5 mA</u></pre>
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>
          Additionally, for the pushbutton, a larger 10k &#937 resistor is used in order to reduce the amount of current
          going through the button as well as to reduce the chances of damaging the arduino.

      <h4>
        Question 2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Since my circuit uses three consective red LEDs, they will each draw the same amount of current over a period of time.
        The following calculation below shows how much current is running through 3 red LEDs:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Calculation (4 red LEDs):</p>
      <pre>5V - 3.3V = 1.7 V</pre>
      <pre>1.7 V / 220 &#937 = 0.0077 A or 7.7 mA per LED</pre>
      <pre>7.7 mA * 4 = <u>0.0308 A or 3.08 mA total</u></pre>
      <br>
      <p>
        With a 1200 mAh battery and a total of 3.08 mA running through the LEDs, the following calculation
        shows how long the circuit can run for:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Calculation (total run time):</p>
      <pre>1200 mAh / 3.08 mA = <u>390 hours</u></pre>
      <br>
      <p>
        Based on the conducted calculations, my circuit running my constructed code, while using a 1200 mAh battery, will 
        run for about 390 hours.

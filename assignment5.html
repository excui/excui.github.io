        <figcaption>
          This is the schematic for the following LED strip circuit controlled with a remote.
          The circuit utilizes an IR receiver, which the schematic is located on the right hand side.
          The remainder of the schematic focuses on the transistor and the LED strip, which are connected to the
          12V power source.
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>
          For the transistor, we know from the datasheet that it can handle a maximum of 80 A. However, we know
          that our transistor only draws extremely small values of current in order to control a large ammount of voltage being 
          supplied by our 12V power source. The 80 A value is only an absolute maximum, while in reality, our circuit is using much
          less, probably around 1 &mu;A based on the datasheet's I(DSS) or Zero Gate Voltage Drain Current.

          This short clip shows how the brightness of the LED strip changes based on the button that is pressed.
          When selecting the upwards arrow, the LED strip is at a brighter level than when the downwards arrow is pressed.

    <div class="question">
      <h4>
        Question 1: What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3 for a n-mosfet transistor?
      </h4>
      <p>Based on the datasheet, the maxiumum amount of current between pins 2 (drain) and 3 (source) is 1 &mu;A.
      </p>

    <div class="question">
      <h4>
        Question 2: Draw a schematic for a circuit with using at least your arduino, a DC motor, a flyback diode, and capacitors between power and ground. Find parts with datasheets you could use for each of these schematic components.
      </h4>
      <img src="a5-question2.jpg" />
      <p>
        The following link contains the datasheet for the 100uF capacitor:
        <a href="https://www.electron.com/electrolytic-capacitor-jamicon-skr101m1hf11m-p1290/">Electrolytic Radial E 100uF/50V</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A 100 uF capacitor is used in this circuit to help smooth out the power being delivered to the motors and also helps to create the right sound when the motors are active.

      <h4>
        Question 3: Draw a schematic using at least your arduino, this chip, and two motors. Write (pseudo) code that shows how you would move the motors both forward, both back, then one forward one back, and one back then forward.

        For the pseudocode, I referenced the following video to help me understand how the code for a DC motor with an H-bridge works:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU17L650k3s&ab_channel=ScienceBuddies">DC Motor Control with an H-Bridge and Arduino (Lesson #17)</a>

        My pseudocode is adjusted to the requirements of the question using 2 motors.
